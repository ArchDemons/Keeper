OpenDungeonKeeper
=================

Dungeon Keeper II clone

Goal is to fully implement the game (1.7 with 3 bonus packs) as open source version, with minimal or no changes at all, using the original game assets. So it will require the original game to play / develop. Futher development could have fan made graphics and features.

Implementation is done in JAVA using JMonkeyEngine (http://jmonkeyengine.org/).
